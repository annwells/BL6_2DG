# Sample Description

RNAseq was performed on four samples per tissue (heart, hippocampus, hypothalamus, kidney, liver, prefrontal cortex, skeletal muscle, small intestine, and spleen) and treatment (2DG or control). Pair-end sequencing was performed using novaseq platform. depth 20 million both ways. read length 150 bp both ways.
